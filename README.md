# Westland Access Control
PWA for project access control specifically for Westland Construction.

## Minimum App Requirements
- db of people who can access a project
- printable ID cards w/ qr codes
- scanner that checks access without leaving the page (for scanning groups of people quickly)

<!-- ## Design Decisions
- I went with a PWA because it's going to be a fairly lite app. Load times shouldn't be a problem especially if I implement cacheing.  -->
